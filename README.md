# Online Tracking: User Perspective and Challenges

This project is a comprehensive study of user interaction with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and their challenges in navigating online tracking. 

## Project Overview

The research was focused on understanding why users find it difficult to defend themselves from online tracking. It also explored how choosing to reject previously accepted privacy settings makes it harder for users to opt-out compared to accepting new ones. The correlation between data protection laws, the provision of PETs by websites, and the user awareness and utilization of these PETs was investigated.

## Methodology

This research employed a multifaceted approach. An evaluation of the top 100 EU websites was carried out, revealing that information regarding PETs was often presented beyond the basic cookie notice. This survey gave insights into how users typically discover PETs for tracking protection, often independently or with assistance from acquaintances.

Furthermore, an online survey involving 614 participants from the UK, France, and Germany was conducted to gather more insights into consumers' tracking protection habits. 

## Key Findings

The research found a significant disconnect between what websites advertise as tracking protection and how users report their actions. This disconnect highlighted why current procedures and rules struggle to encourage users to adopt PETs effectively. 

## Implications

The findings from this study bring attention to the challenges faced by users in protecting their online privacy and highlight areas for improvement in the design and communication of PETs.
